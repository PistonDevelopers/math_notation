### Zen Rationality

Instrumental Rationality is a philosophical framework where one assumes:

- The agent has a goal it wants to optimize
- The agent can trust its own decisions in the future in the absence of new evidence

Link to [Instrumental Rationality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  
*Notice! The position that Instrumental Rationality is the whole of practical rationality,
has been proven wrong by construction of the LOST (Local Optimal Safety Theory) algorithm.
AdvancedResearch's current position is that the whole of practical rationality requires at least some Zen Rationality.*

Zen Rationality is an extension of Instrumental Rationality with higher order reasoning about goals.

This means:

- The agent might have no specific goal, it might have many, or it might have conflicting goals
- The agent might not trust its own decisions in the future (e.g. believing it might suddenly turn off or fail)

Before you try to understand Zen Rationality, it is useful to first learn about the kind of "rationality" that is closer to human thinking than Instrumental Rationality, called "Self Rationality":
