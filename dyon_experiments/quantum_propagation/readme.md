# Quantum Propagation Explorer

[Quantum Propagation](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip/quantum-propagation.pdf) is an algorithm that replaces
the Born rule for measurements with an infinite non-deterministic series that converges to same probabilities.
The cover of random paths is a research topic in [Non-Deterministic Path Semantics](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/sequences.md#non-deterministic-path-semantics).

Here I post screenshots with formulas of interesting quantum functions.
