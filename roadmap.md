# Roadmap

The roadmap uses NASA's standard "Engineer Design Process".

### 1. Identify the problem

Normal paths are useful in combination with notation for standard mathematics, however:

- Not covered by current type theoretic or set theoretic foundations
- We understand the idea, but there are lots of edge cases (formal issues)
- Lack of basic logical framework

### 2. Identify resources and constraints

- We do not need a full fledged language, bootstrapping is sufficient
- Operations needed are reducible to path semantical qubit operator `~`
- Extend Propositional Logic with path semantical qubit operator `~`

### 3. Research

- HOOO Exponential Propositions (needed for proper substitution in `~`)
- Core axiom of Path Semantics (entry-point of bootstrapping process)
- Path semantical levels of propositions (symmetries of the core axiom)

### 4. Develop solutions

### 5. Select the best solution

### 6. Build the solution

### 7. Test and evaluate the solution

### 8. Record and present the results

### 9. Improve the solution
